## Non-linear data Structure â€” Tree, Graph

### Tree

- Is hierarchical structure with root node, siblings, nodes, parent nodes, etc.
- Nodes are connected with edges/branches from parents to children.
- A node can one have one parent
- Operations on tree,
  - Traversal
  - Sorting
  - Searching
  - Insertion
  - Deletion
  - etc.

### Graph

- Graph is non linear data structure which is collection of nodes and edges.
- Nodes are connected with edges.
- A node can be connected back to itself through other nodes.

## Basic Terms

### General Tree -

- A tree where each node has most two child nodes.

### Forest -

- Collection of multiple trees

### Level Numbers -

- The level or depth of a node form the root with the root at level 0

### degree -

- The number of sub trees or child nodes.

### in-degree -

- Number of incoming edges to node.

### out-degree -

- Number of outgoing edges from a node.

### root node -

- Top level node forming entire tree.

### leaf node -

- A tree with no children node.

### directed edges -

- a edge with defined direction from one node to another.

### path -

- sequence of nodes connected by edges that allow traversing the graph.

### depth -

- number of edges from the root node to last specified node
- similar as level.

## Application of binary tree

### BST -

- Used Binary trees are used for efficient searching and retrieval of data, especially when the data is sorted.

### File system -

- Binary trees are used to organize files and directories in a hierarchical file system structure.

### Decision Trees -

- Binary trees can also used for decision tree which helps to manage decision making process.

### Sorting -

- binary tree are used to implement sorting algorithm to order items.

### Search engines -

- Binary trees are used in search engines to organize and index web pages.

### Priority queues -

- Binary trees can be implemented as priority queues which are data structures that allow elements to be prioritized and retrieved in specific order.
