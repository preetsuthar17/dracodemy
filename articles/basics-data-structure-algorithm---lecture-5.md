## Notation for Algorithm design

1. Name of algorithm:

   - Every algorithm is given an identifying name written capital letters.
   - Example:
     - ARRAY_SEARCH(option1, option2)

2. Steps:

   - The actual algorithm is made up of a number of steps each starting with a phrase enclosed in square brackets which gives a description of that step.
   - Example:
     - Step 1 [Description of step]<br/>
       Instruction.

3. Assignment statement:

   - It is indicated by placing an arrow between the right-hand side and left-hand side of the statement and the variable receiving the value.
   - Example:
     - A <- 10

4. If statement:

   - This helps to add conditions in the algorithm.
   - Example:
     - if(condition)<br/>then this<br/>else

5. Case statement:

   - The case statement is used for multiple choice type solution.

6. Repeat statement:

   - It is used to create loops in the algorithm.
     - While loop
     - For loop
   - Example:
     - Repeat while (condition)

7. Goto statement:

   - This goto statement causes unconditional transfer of control to the step referenced.

8. exit statement:
   - It is used to terminate an algorithm.

## Advantages of the Algorithm

- It is a step-by-step representation of a real-life solution.
- It is easier to understand.
- It is not dependent on any programming language.
- It can work as a blueprint for the program to develop.
- By using an algorithm the problem is broken down into smaller parts hence it is easy for a programmer to convert it into an actual program.

## Disadvantages of an Algorithm

- It is time-consuming.
- It is difficult to show branching and looping in an algorithm.
- Big problems are difficult to solve using algorithms.

## Example of an Algorithm

SUM OF TWO NUMBERS

Step 1: [Initialization]<br/>Take two inputs numbers from the user: a,b

Step 2: [Compute Sum]<br/>Sum = a+b

Step 3: [Print result]<br/> Print Sum

step 4: [Finish]
