## Arrays Operations

Let's talk about operations that can be done on array in Data Structure.

## Traversing

- Accessing each data element in such a way that all the data elements are processed one by one.

## Insertion

- Adding new data element in Array.

## Deletion

- removing data element from Array.

## Searching

- Finding location for specific data in Array.

## Sorting

- Arranging array data in some logical order

## Merging

- Combining two array elements into single array.

## Array Traversing Example

```c
  int a[10];
  int count = 0;
  int UB; // Value of this will be size of array.

  while(count <= UB){
    count += 1;
  }

```
