## Data Structure

- It is a way of storing and organizing data in the computer system, which can be used and accessed efficiently.
- It is a technique or method of studying how the data are interrelated to each other logically or mathematically.
- The study of _Data structure_ covers following points,
  - the amount of memory required to store data.
  - Amount of time required to process data.

### Data

- Collection of any information or facts with keys and values which can be late accessed.
- It is processed and organized in a meaningful way.

### Information

- When a lot of data is processed returns some details which are called "information"
- It is created in the form of data.

### Cell

The specific location in memory where data can be stored is called a "Cell".

- It can be referred to as a single bit, Byte, or group of Bytes.

### Field

- The smallest piece of information that can be stored in the data structure.

### Record

- Collection of information about particular items.

### File

- Collection of records

## Advantages of Data Structure

1. The data is stored in the hard drive of the computer.
2. Changes or manipulation in the value of data structure can be done easily.
3. Data can be accessed easily anytime anywhere.
4. Data structure provides models for real-life problems

## Application of Data Structure

1. It can be used for compiler designs.
2. It can be used for computer graphics.
3. Also it is used in operating systems.
4. For database management system.
5. Artificial intelligence and more...

## Types of Data Structure

Let's see types of data structure without deep diving, into the basics.

1. Primitive:
   - It contains fundamentals for basic datatypes
   - For example, Int, Float, Boolean
2. Non-primitive:
   - User-defined datatypes created and derived using primitive datatypes.
   - For example, Structure, Class, Union
3. Linear data structure:
   - Type of data structure where data is stored with a particular sequence.
   - For example, Arrays, Queue, Stacked.
4. Non-Linear data structure:
   - Type of data structure where data is stored without a particular sequence. [Randomly]
   - For example, Tree, Graph.
5. Homogeneous data structure:
   - Type of data structure where data is stored with similar types of data.
   - For example, Arrays.
6. Non-Homogeneous structure:
   - Type of data structure where the datatype of data doesn't need to be similar to Homogeneous.
   - For example, Structure, Class.
7. Static data structure:
   - In this data structure the values are fixed in memory which cannot be changed in run time.
   - No expansion in memory during runtime.
8. Dynamic data structure:
   - Changes can be made in runtime.
   - No fixed memory value.
   - possible to expand memory areas by adding or deleting data.
