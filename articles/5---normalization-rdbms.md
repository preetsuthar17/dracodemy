## Basics of Normalization

- Normalization is method or technique used to eliminate data redundancy and ensures the data integrity between tables.
  - It decreases data redundancy.
  - It ensures the data integrity of tables.
- There are three types of Normalizations

  - 1NF (First Normal Form)
  - 2NF (Second Normal Form)
  - 3NF (Third Normal Form)

- 1NF (First Normal Form) -

  - First normal form in this table the data should not be repeating in single row.
  - Every row and data must be unique.

  - In above example we have two author data in single column and single row.
  - Now if we use First Normal Form we eliminate the repeating data.

- 2NF (Second Normal Form) -

  - It is already in First Normal Form, which means each row and data is unique.
  - All data are fully dependent on primary key.
  - It divides tables in multiple tables which helps to improve data integrity and reduce data redundancy.
  - It helps to organize the data and tables in database.

  - In above example we have where CourseID is primary key and there are total 3 columns,
  - Now using Second Normal Form we can divide the data referencing primary key in other tables.

- 3NF (Third Normal Form) -

  - Must be Second Normal Form before Third Normal Form.
  - No non-key attributes are directly dependent on the primary key

  - Now using Third Normal Form we can divide single table into two tables using one of the column data and referencing a column from one table into another table.

## Advantages of normalization —

- Reduces data redundancy and inconsistency.
- Helps achieving data integrity.
- Provides clear structure to the data.
- Makes data retrieval more efficient.
- By organizing data it'll enhances the reliability of the database.
- Normalization improves performance of the database and makes it faster.

## Disadvantages of normalization —

- Very complex to implement.
- May require extra joins in tables to make it work.
- Makes the structure complex which can slow down the queries and processes.
- It increases the database size.
- Using normalization it can reduce flexibility.
