## Let's talk about operations we can perform on data structures

Here operations basically means changing the existing data structure or creating a new one.

## Operations on primitive data structure

1. Creation:
   - This operation is used to create a new data structure.
2. Destroy:
   - This operation is used to delete or destroy a new data structure.
     - For example: `free function`
3. Selection:
   - This operation is used to access data structure.
4. Update:
   - This operation is used to commit or make new changes or update data structure.

## Operations on non-primitive data structure

1. Transversing:
   - Transversing means each element in the data structure is accessed and processed at least once.
2. Sorting:
   - It means arranging elements in the data structure with some logical order.
3. Searching:
   - Searching means finding the location of the element with a given key value.
4. Merging:
   - It is the process of combining different elements into one sorted list.
5. Insertion:
   - Adding a new element to the data structure.
6. Deletion:
   - Deleting specific items from the data structure.
7. Splitting:
   - It is the process of partitioning a single list into multiple lists.
