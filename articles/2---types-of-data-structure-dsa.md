## Types

There are many types of Data Structure but in this lesson we're going to talk about two main types of data Structure.

1. Primitive Data Structure
2. Non Primitive Data Structure

### Other Types

1. Primitive Data Structure
2. Non Primitive Data Structure
3. Linear Data Structure
4. Non Linear Data Structure
5. Static Data Structure
6. Dynamic Data Structure
7. Homogeneous Data Structure
8. Non Homogeneous Data Structure

## 1. Primitive Data Structure

- The primitive data types are the fundamental datatypes.
- Example: Int Float Double, Char
- Now in the primitive, there are two types,

  - 1. Numeric:

    - Int: Numbers with positive, negative values and whole numbers basically not decimal
      - Example: 23,6,0,1
    - Real numbers or float numbers: These represent numbers having decimal points.
      - Example: 1.5, 3.534, 0.43

  - 2. Non Numeric:

    - CHAR: character type of data.
      - Example: a to OR A to Z
    - Pointer: It is a datatype that represents the memory address of a variable. Pointers can also be used to access the memory address of a variable.

  - 3. Booleans: AKA logical,
    - It can represent value either as TRUE or FALSE.
      - 0 = False, 1 = True

## 2. Non Primitive Data Structure

- These can be derived using any primitive datatype
- There are two types of Primitive Datatype

  1. Linear Data Structure:

     - Array:
       - It is a collection of similar kinds of data.
     - Stack:

       - In data structure, insertion and deletion are performed at one end only.
       - It is also known as LIFO [Last in First out]

     - Queue:

       - In data structure, insertion at one end and deletion at the other end.
       - It is also known as FIFO [First in First out]

     - List:
       - A list can be defined as a collection of variables of a number of items.

## 2. Non-linear Data Structure

- Tree: [We'll learn more about this in upcoming lectures]

- Graph:
  - It is a collection of vertices (Node) and edges.
